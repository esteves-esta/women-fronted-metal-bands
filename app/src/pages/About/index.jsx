            This project started when I realized that most metal/rock band that
            I usually listened all had men as lead vocalist. And this
            realization lead me to search for bands with women as lead
            vocalists, and specially where said vocalist isnâ€™t just doing the
            melodic parts but doing lots of growling.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            So I decided to make this page to compile the bands that I found and
            also pratice my frontend skills. You can filter bands by how much
            growling the singer is capable of doing.
