This project is a list of the bands of diferent metal genres and also an way of me to pratice frontend. 

I didn‚Äôt add genres of the bands as some don‚Äôt have it on there websites and a lot of bands change with time, so instead of genre you can filter bands by how much growling the singer can / or usually do on the songs of the band.
