            vocalists.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This project started when I realized that most metal/rock band that I usually listened all had men as lead vocalist.
          And this realization lead me to search for bands with women as lead
          vocalists, and specially where said vocalist isnâ€™t just doing the melodic parts but doing lots of growling. </p>
        <p>So I decided to make this page to compile the bands that I found and also pratice my frontend
          skills. You can filter bands by how much growling the singer is capable of doing.</p>

        <small className="text-sm">Note: This is an ongoing project. To see from where these data has been collected{" "}
