            vocalists.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This project started when I realized that most metal/rock band that I usually listened all had men as lead vocalist. 
          And this realization lead me to search for bands with women as lead
          vocalists, and specially where said vocalist isn’t just doing the melodic parts but doing lots of growling. </p>
        <p>So I decided to make this page to compile the bands that I found and also pratice my frontend
          skills. I didn’t add genres of the bands as some don’t have it on there websites and a lot of bands change with
          time, so instead of genre you can filter bands by how much growling the singer can / usually do on the songs of
          the band.</p>
